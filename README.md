# Data-analysis-for-CHC-crime

The “Crime in New Zealand at a glance” report shows the victimisations recorded by police for the year ending December 2020. Compared to the previous 12 months, theft and related offences have decreased by 10.1%, burglary decreased, however assault increased 12.4%. Data analytics around criminal activity is an important part of implementing preventative measures. Understanding which types of criminal activity are decreasing or increasing can help identify which preventative measures work. It also helps to ensure police can effectively deploy their resources. 

Using existing data on crime in Christchurch, we would like to better understand how crime rates have changed over the last five years and which areas have the highest rates of crime. We then intend to create a model to use to predict crime trends. By analysing the data, we will seek to identify what time of the day and what day of the week crime occurs in Christchurch. We intend to seek an appropriate tool to build a model to identify crime hotspots in different areas of Christchurch and use this to predict the occurrence of type of crime in different areas of Christchurch at a particular time.

We are going to use temporal data for the initial analysis, then build a model to predict the type of crime at a certain place and time. We have also included spatial data in our analysis.

The key problems that we are trying to resolve using data analytics are as follows:
  1.	To identify trends in the number of crimes occurring in Christchurch over the past five years
  2.	To identify the crime hotspots in Christchurch 
  3.	To predict the future crime numbers in Christchurch
  4.	To identify the day of the week and time of the day where certain types of crime occur in Christchurch 
  5.	To predict the occurrence of types of crime in different areas of Christchurch at a particular time.

Identifying the top criminal hotspots in the different areas of Christchurch would enable authorities to have knowledge about which areas need higher levels of resources and require more vigilance and controlling practices. By being able to identify the time and day of the occurrence of the type of crimes, police would be able to be prepared for the type of crime that that area is susceptible to and can increase patrolling and take more stringent measures to control crime.

Classifying past crimes and creating a predictive temporal model will help the police to apply their limited resources more efficiently. With such an insight the police will be able to apply appropriate forces preemptively in place for the types of crimes predicted to occur in a certain area on a certain day. With an effective strategy, the crimes will be able to be stopped before happening or be tracked or profiled significantly faster than before. It would also help residents of the area to better understand the consequences of moving to or from a certain neighborhood.

While similar analysis has been undertaken in the United States of America to identify trends and hotspots where crime occurs, we were unable to identify any evidence of work predicting types of crime occurring at a particular day and time in Christchurch.
